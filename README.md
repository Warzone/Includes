# Includes

This repository contains a collection of reusable XML files adopted for use across Warzone.

## Usage

Please see the [Include Statements](https://pgm.dev/docs/modules/general/main/#include-statements)  section covered in PGM Documentation.

## Contributing

-   All includes must have valid XML syntax. The map protocol must be `1.4.2`.
-   Includes must be extensively tested as they have the potential to affect many maps.

## Acknowledgements

This repository represents the combined efforts of several map developers and contributors. 
We'd like to credit the following:
-   Overcast Network - for creating the includes that allowed us to build maps with several popular game modes within the PGM community and elsewhere.
-   [MCResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/) - for their hard work compiling and archiving several includes from Overcast Network, making them available for public download and use.
-   Overcast Community's [PublicMaps](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/PublicMaps/tree/main/includes) - for their continued efforts in maintaining and updating includes files, making them available for everyone.
